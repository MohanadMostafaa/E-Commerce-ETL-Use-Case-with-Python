# E-Commerce-ETL-Use-Case-with-Python

## Overview

This project aims to manage and analyze data related to an e-commerce platform. It involves tasks such as data extraction, transformation, loading (ETL), modeling, and visualization. The project primarily deals with multiple datasets containing information about orders, products, customers, staff, stores, and more.

## Requirements

To run this project, you need the following:

- Python 3.x
- Required Python packages: pandas, matplotlib, seaborn

## Project Structure

The project is organized into several stages:

1. **Data Extraction**: Raw data is obtained from various sources, including CSV files located in specific directories.

2. **Data Transformation**: Data preprocessing and cleaning tasks are performed, including handling missing values, data type conversions, and merging datasets.

3. **Data Loading**: The transformed data is exported to staging directories for further analysis and modeling.

4. **Modeling**: Exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualization are conducted to gain insights into the data.


## Usage

1. **Data Extraction and Transformation**:
   - Run `etl.py` script to perform data extraction, transformation, and loading tasks.
   - The script extracts data from raw CSV files, transforms it, and exports cleaned data to staging directories.

2. **Modeling and Visualization**:
   - Run `modeling.py` script to conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualize insights.
   - The script reads cleaned data from staging directories and generates visualizations for further analysis.
